 # NetworkC

 This is an under development project which aims to create a C++ library similar to the NetworkX package in Python. Manipulating and analyzing Graphs is an important problem in many
 usecases and sometimes Python is not the best tool for specific tasks since it's much slower then C++ due to it's interpreted nature and using C++ can be beneficial when analyzing
 large networks. Unfortunatelly the NetworkX project is developed in Python unlike torch or numpy which are developed in C/C++ hence the need for a faster alternative emerges.
